## About The Project

NoruPad is a note-taking web application concept coded with Laravel. This project was first made for my web development class final project submission. This version of NoruPad is the RestAPI version of the OG. No Front-end included, ran on postman. 

## Special Thanks to

My dearest mentors, Ms. Nina and Ms. Dean, for guiding me through the journey of learning RestAPI.
